Our AI assistant handles the grunt work while humans spend their time on things they do best. Our product is the world’s first artificial intelligence assistant trained to solve the hardest problems in the insurance industry. Underwriters work with the Sixfold assistant to improve their capacity, accuracy, and speed. The Sixfold assistant can identify the risks in submissions, prior losses, external data lookups, and more. Sixfold solves the ""front-door problem"" faced by many carriers, allowing them to more quickly evaluate and rate all submissions, prioritizing the best risks.
Why we’re excited about this space: We’re building the copilot for insurance underwriters. As generative AI is being used to tackle all types of use cases, insurance has a unique set of challenges. We’re serving a core business function that protects everything from your small business to a large trucking fleet. We believe we have the right solution to better serve this population and scale quickly. Our team is made of former founders and operators with experience in enterprise, B2B, eCommerce, and consumer products. Who you are: As an early engineer of Sixfold, you will have the opportunity to influence the foundation and growth of our business.
Passionate about building and scaling systems: You understand the foundations of how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Care deeply about end-user experience: You take pride in building products to solve customer needs. You partner closely with team members to craft beautiful onboarding and underwriting experiences.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real-time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Qualifications: You have 5 + years of professional software engineering experience
You have experience in building web-based product experiences
You understand the basics of web accessibility and internationalization and can explain cross-origin and content security policies. You are fluent with TypeScript , or at least with JavaScript , and you have a favorite set of tools you reach for, including linters, formatters, and test frameworks. You are no stranger to building application servers with Express or similar frameworks. You are familiar with React and its ecosystem. You can explain the lifecycle of a component, describe the functionality and gotchas of the hooks you use most frequently, and talk through popular approaches to routing and state management. You are familiar with Ruby on Rails and know its patterns well enough to build features in a Rails app without significant learning time. Extra credit if you have experience with Action Cable, Active Storage, or Sidekiq. You want to work in an early-stage, fast-growth tech company
You are comfortable with ambiguity and change. You can own problems and proactively devise solutions for them, not just wait for somebody to feed you tasks to execute. You love communication, collaboration, and execution
